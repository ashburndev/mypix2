simple Grails 2.4.0 web application to upload photos

I created the mypix2 project primarily as a vehicle to explore the functionality
of the Grails 2.4.0 framework.

I have been using a milestone release (M1) of GGTS 3.6.0 for this project,
because it is the first build of GGTS that ships with the Grails 2.4.0 Release.
The *mypix1* project is loosly based on a project I created some time ago for work,
but this version has been "re-written from scratch".  In addition to
using this project to gain experience with Grails 2.4.0, I was never quite
satisfied with the domain class structure used to persist the content in that
earlier project, and I am experimenting here with alternatives.  One other
objective was to learn how to deploy a Grails web application to my newly created,
free AWS account.  I also wanted to gauge whether or not an ASW EC2 micro instance
is suitable for hosting a Grails web application.
